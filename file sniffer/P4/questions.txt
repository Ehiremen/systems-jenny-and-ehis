Hi Dr. Fischer, these are any last minute questions we had (doesn't affect the final product though):

1.  Instead of recursively calling Sniff::travel to handle sub directories,
    could we just have had a stack/queue of simple names of directories
    to visit? (It would have added the name of new dirs as they showed up)
    If that were the case, could we have just had a loop that ran until the stack/queue was empty?
    
2.  In Sniff::Sniff we initialized path and current to "."
    We'd assumed "." was the simple name for our starting directory.
    Is there any reason why we'd want its actual name (e.g. "dir") if
    we're already in that directory?
    Like, would we ever want to chdir("dir") when we're already in "dir"?
