/*
 Comments on output:
 
 For test e:
*   mytemp.txt was created because of the "> mytemp.txt" when executing P1 from
    the command line.
*   mytemp.txt comes out empty because there's no html file in the program's
    directory. Personally, I wonder why the system didn't treat the "*.html" as
    an empty arg when it realized there were no html files.
*   after further testing, it seems like it's because I don't have any html file
    in my directory. I tried taking out different switches from e, and I
    narrowed it down to the "*.html". Also, things worked out when I put a
    .html file into my directory
 
 For test f:
*   both bak files in my directory show up in my .txt file.
*   Interestingly, there isn't any log file, but test f doesn't return empty
    (whereas test e was empty for a similar reason).
